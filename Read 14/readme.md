# Transforms
*With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.*
### Transform Syntax
* The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.


div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}

### Transitions & Animations
*Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.*
