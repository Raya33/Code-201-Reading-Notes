# Links
**Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.**

### Writing Links
*Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.*

### Relative URLs
*Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.*

### Building Blocks
*CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.*

### LAyout
* <div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
*Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects
*Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.*

*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).*
