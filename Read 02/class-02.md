# Text
**Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs**
* Headings<h1-----h6>
* Paragraphs <p>
* Bold & Italic <b> ,<i>
* Superscript &
Subscrip <sup> ,<sub>
* Line Breaks &
Horizontal Rules <br /> ,<hr />

**Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on**
* Strong & Emphasis <strong> ,<em>
* Quotations There are two elements commonly used for marking up quotations: <blockquote> ,<q>
* Abbreviations & Acronyms <abbr>,
* Citations Definitions <cite>,<dfn>

## Introducing CSS
*CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.*

*CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration*

*CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.*

## Basic JavaScript Instructions
#### STATEMENTS 
*A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon.*

#### COMMENTS 
*You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code*

#### VARIABLE
*A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.*

#### DATA TYPES 
*JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans.*

#### ARRAYS 
*An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values.*

#### EXPRESSIONS 
*An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking*

#### OPERATORS 
*Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.*

## Decisions and Loops
#### Operators and Loops
## Operators
*Operators are the symbols which are used to perform certain operations on the data e.g.*
* +	Addition
* -	Subtraction
* *	Multiplication
* /	Division
* %	Modulus (remainder) ( e.g. 3%2 = 1)
* ++	“Increment (e.g. if a = 1, then a++ = 2)”
* –	“Decrement (e.g. if a = 1, then a– = 0)”
* += -= *= /=	short notation (e.g.’a += 3’ indicates ‘a = a+3’
* equal	==
* not equal	!=
* greater	>
* smaller	<
* greater or equal	>=
* smaller or equal	<=
* OR	|
* AND	&
* XOR	^
* NOT	~
* Left Shift	<<
* Right Shift	>>
* &&	Logical AND operator
* ||	Logical OR Operator
* !	Logical NOT Operator
## Loops
*Loops are used to perform the operations repetitively. Three types of loop conditions‘for loop’, ‘while loop’ and ‘do while loop’*
