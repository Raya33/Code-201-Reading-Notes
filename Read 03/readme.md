# Lists
**There are lots of occasions when we
need to use lists. HTML provides us with
three different types:**
* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number. <ol>

* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).<ul>

* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

*<li> Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)*

# Boxes
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

# Decisions and Loops
*switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).*

*Data types can be coerced from one type to another*

*All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.*

*There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.*
